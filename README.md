# Laptop Price Prediction

## Project Overview

The Laptop Price Prediction project leverages machine learning to accurately forecast laptop prices based on various specifications. This project aims to assist consumers, businesses, and retailers in making informed purchasing decisions.

## Objectives

- Develop a robust machine learning model to predict laptop prices.
- Analyze and preprocess a comprehensive dataset of laptop specifications.
- Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Gather a dataset containing laptop specifications such as CPU, RAM, storage, screen size, etc.
   - Handle missing values and standardize the dataset.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Identify and engineer relevant features to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Use Python and the scikit-learn library for model development.
   - Implement multiple machine learning models, including regression and ensemble methods.
   - Fine-tune the models to optimize performance.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Assess the model's accuracy using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
   - Employ cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/laptop-price-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd laptop-price-prediction
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare the dataset and place it in the `data` directory.
2. Run the preprocessing script:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```
3. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
4. Make predictions:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --input data/sample_input.csv --output data/predictions.csv
   ```

## Results

- The model achieved an MAE of X, RMSE of Y, and R-squared of Z on the test dataset.
- The predictions are saved in the `data/predictions.csv` file.
